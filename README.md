# Notice
This server is no longer useful. The Sync project is still alive, but the client is being rewriten to use only a Google Drive storage location, precluding the need for a version control server.

Please refer to the client: https://github.com/twetzel59/undefinedsync

I'll leave this here for the sake of documentation, but it is considered abandoned.
